<h1>Category cache has been cleared</h1>
<p>Your changes will now be shown on the frontend. Parts of the admin may not respond so that all the data can be made live as they were when the button was pressed. Please be patient. If you see an error screen soon after pressing this then don't worry! This is just because the admin is not ready yet. Try again in a few minutes.</p>
