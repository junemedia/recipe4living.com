						<h3>Kathryn Steed, Editor</h3>
						<p>Kathryn has always been a "spelling and grammar Nazi," so to speak, so becoming an editor 
						for Recipe4Living was a dream come true!  She grew up in the Chicago suburbs and attended the 
						University of St. Andrews in St. Andrews, Scotland to get her BA in English and Spanish.  Her time 
						living in the UK and traveling throughout Europe played a huge part in expanding her palate and she 
						has eaten all sorts of strange and interesting local dishes, bugs included.</p>
						<p><b>Best meal ever?</b>  Ever?  That's a toughie.  Lately, it has been the tapas and paella 
						at <a href="http://www.latascatapas.com/index2.html" target="_blank">La Tasca</a> in Arlington Heights, IL.  Then again, I 
						did have some incredible sushi at <a href="http://www.saucemagazine.com/wasabi/" target="_blank">Wasabi Sushi Bar</a> in 
						St. Louis, MO.  And then there were those mussels in Belgium...And that cheese fondue in 
						Switzerland...I might have to get back to you on this one!</p>
						
						<p><b>Can she cook?</b>
							I'm learning!  I'm still a pasta and stir-fry girl, but after finding some great recipes on 
							Recipe4Living, I started experimenting and trying out new dishes.  I'm trying to make my way 
							to a risotto.  Wish me luck!</p>
						
						<p><b>The foods she can't live without?</b>
							I'm strangely obsessed with giant pretzels.  Every time I go to an amusement park or fair, 
							I have to have one.  I also need to have sushi at least once every 2 weeks.  Other favorite 
							foods include avocadoes, caramelized onions, cheeses of all kinds, and astronaut ice cream 
							(that freeze-dried stuff you get at museums and novelty stores).</p>
							
						<p><b>Favorite cookbook?</b>
							I'm really loving my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979938414?ie=UTF8&tag=coowittrajoes-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0979938414" target="_blank">
							Cooking with All Things Trader Joe's</a> cookbook right now.  
							Its recipes are super easy but taste like gourmet meals.</p>

						<h3>Sophia Venetos, Editor</h3>
						<p>Sophia's lucky to have been born in a family where everyone seems to naturally be a fabulous cook. She's been avidly watching her grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles cook anything and everything over the years, including the world's best cheesecake and a soup made of the liver, heart, lung and intestines of a lamb. It's better than it sounds! Sophia is also an avid reader and writer. As a kid, she would spend all of her allowance on new books, and she hopes to have her own personal library one day. Sophia has lived a block outside of Chicago all her life. She graduated from Loyola University Chicago with a degree in journalism. Sophia is excited to dive into the world of food and cooking, and hopes to join the ranks of her highly-experienced family members one day!</p>
						<p><b>So, can she cook?</b> She can definitely bake! While Sophia doesn't claim to be a top chef by any means, she can bake some top-notch peanut butter chocolate cookies. Her green bean casserole is a hit every Thanksgiving, and she loves to try any new breakfast recipe she can get her hands on. Sophia is starting to develop her cooking skills more and more from her mom and grandparents, and wants to be proficient in all Greek recipes, including the ever-so-tricky dessert baklava and pastitsio, or Greek-style lasagna, in a few years.</p>
						<p><b>Most disastrous kitchen moment:</b> Back in her tomboy years, Sophia's cooking group in her home economics class consisted of her and three of her guy friends. She figured she could show them a thing or two about cooking. Well, she was very wrong. Sophia managed to burn a grilled cheese sandwich and drop pieces of egg shell in cookie batter within the first three weeks of the class. She was then demoted to the dish washer for the rest of the semester, but still got a taste of everything the boys made. Luckily, she has improved her skills greatly since then!</p>
						<p><b>Any favorite restaurants?</b> Greek Islands Restaurant in downtown Chicago is the best Greek restaurant in America with its phenomenal lamb chops! PJ's Oyster Bar in Florida for the best clam chowder. I'm also a major fan of Corner Bakery. I love their chicken pesto sandwich.</p>
						<p><b>Favorite Cookbook:</b> I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence by Amy Sedaris because it makes me laugh, while giving me new and interesting recipes. Also, the recipe book my church distributes. It has all the best Greek recipes out there!</p>

						<h3>Allison Evans, Editor</h3>
						<p>I have been a vegetarian for 7 years now. This decision was spurred by a long-awaited epiphany in which I overhauled my entire way of eating. While I don't consider myself a great cook by any stretch, the purchase of a few key cookbooks and a rice cooker have got me trying new and interesting recipes on a much more regular basis, and I am learning how awesome it is to make delicious and healthy food!</p>
						<p>I am also a huge fitness fanatic, although my passion is running! I enjoy scouring the area for local races and lining my Saturday mornings with 5ks, 10ks and half marathons! In January 2010, I ran my first marathon in the most magical place in the world - Walt Disney World! It was hard...or rather, excruciating at times, but there was no better feeling in the world than accomplishing a task that seemed impossible only a few months before. I ran a second marathon in September, and now I am hooked! I am hugely goal-driven and need to consistently set new and challenging fitness goals for myself. My newest goal is to train for a triathlon!</p>

						<h3>Hillary Marshak, Editor</h3>
						
						<!--<img src="<?= SITEASSETURL ?>/images/about/hillary.jpg" />-->
						
						<p>Born and raised a suburban Chicagoan, Hillary has loved editing since the day she was taught to read and write. She would even edit her brothers&rsquo; writing assignments before she was in the third grade. She plays word games for fun, anything from Boggle to Scrabble, but especially Wheel of Fortune. Prior to joining the Recipe4Living team, Hillary was a copy editor for her college newspaper: The Daily Illini. So, if you haven't guessed, she graduated from the University of Illinois (Urbana, Champaign) with a degree in news editorial journalism. Hillary could not be more excited to venture into the online publishing industry with Recipe4Living.com!</p>
						<p><strong>So, can she cook?</strong> A self-proclaimed unusual cook, Hillary's college years left her able to bake brie cheese at 2 in the morning, but unable to master a simple stir fry. She is quite passionate about making the perfect cr&egrave;me brulee (and has come close) but cannot, for the life of her, correctly bake a potato. So, needless to say, Hillary has much to learn in the pragmatic cooking realm, but she plans to improve with the help of Recipe4Living. In the meantime, she wants to tell every beginner cook that you don't have to be able to cook everything to be a great chef!</p>
						
						<p><strong>What is the best meal she has ever had?</strong> TOUGH QUESTION. Some may call it a fad, but there is definitely a great deal of enjoyment to be had while eating fresh-cut sushi. A piece of white tuna or salmon nigiri = gold. But, while I haven't been all around the world to try every exotic cuisine out there, I'd have to say the best meals I've had have been closest to home. To me, there is something overly comforting about a warm bowl of matzo ball soup, a dish of sweet and sour meatballs to dip challah into, or my grandmother's cholent (a stew of meat, potatoes, and barley). So, if I had to pick, Jewish and Japanese cooking top my favorites.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Any favorite restaurants?</strong>:  <a href="http://www.bigbowl.com/" target="_blank">Big Bowl</a> (Ideal meal: lemon chicken, chicken satay and hibiscus iced tea), <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/" target="_blank">Cheesecake Factory</a> (crusted chicken romano) and you guessed it, just about any sushi restaurant out there.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Favorite Cookbook</strong>: Creme Brulee, a compilation of recipes carried by <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/index.cfm?&amp;bnrid=3160101&amp;cm_ven=Google&amp;cm_cat=BrandTerm&amp;cm_pla=WSBrand&amp;cm_ite=william+sonoma" target="_blank">Williams Sonoma</a></p>

						<h3>Nancy Radler, Editor</h3>
						<p>Nancy is enjoying her role as an editor for Recipe4Living. It lets her share her adventures in cooking and eating with others who share a similar experience. Nancy graduated from Regis College in Westin, MA with a double major in Communications and English and then attended The Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. With three boys, one husband and two dogs, she knows how difficult it can be to get a meal on the table every night which is why her favorite meal these days come from a crock pot or a drive-thru. She always has time to indulge her passion for baking, and is said to make the best chocolate chip cookies in the world</p>
						<p><strong>Best Meal Ever</strong>: That's a hard one as I've eaten in Germany, France, Italy, and Mexico and all over the US. However, if I had to pick one it would be at <a href="http://www.queenmary.com/index.php?page=sirwinstons" target="_blank">Sir Winston's Restaurant</a> on the Queen Mary in Long Beach, CA. The restaurant is located on board the Queen Mary, a luxurious ocean liner from the beginning of the 20th century that has been lovingly restored as a hotel using the original art-deco interior. There, my husband and I shared a romantic dinner of Sir Winston's Romaine Salad, Chateaubriand for two and Sir Winston's Chocolate Souffle Served with Cream Anglaise, Chocolate Sauce and Whipped Cream. The view of the Pacific Ocean was breathtaking and the food was divine. And we ate there without the kids.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Most Disastrous Kitchen Moment</strong>: Hands down, the most horrible meal I ever prepared was a Reuben Casserole. To this day, it's the only thing my family can remember that was totally inedible, and even I have to agree with them.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Favorite Cookbook</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/103-1865708-9792627?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=fannie+farmer&amp;Go.x=12&amp;Go.y=14" target="_blank">Fannie Farmer Cookbook</a>; I use it for baking.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Favorite Foods Eaten While Traveling</strong>: Pibil Pork in Mexico, Lobster in Boston, Hot Dogs in Chicago, Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago, Navajo Taco's in Tuba City, Arizona, Buffalo Burgers at Custer State Park in South Dakota, Calzones in Rome, Dijon Mustard Salad in Nice, France and finally, the <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/dining/diningDetail?id=RestaurantMarrakeshDiningPage" target="_blank">Restaurant Marrakesh</a> at Epcot in Disney World; belly dancer and all.</p>
