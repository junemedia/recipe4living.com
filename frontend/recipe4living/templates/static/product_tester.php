					<h2 id="signup">Where can I signup to become a product tester?</h2>
					<p>Excellent question! Sign up <a href="http://www3.recipe4living.com/default.aspx?home=166-28028Q&blockpops=0&allabandonpops=0&allowar=0&blockbanners=0&framebreakout=0&brand=r4lptflow&cid=%7BDF2DC705-72CB-4932-84A3-AB05A99DB4D1%7D&sid=%7BF9349B0C-E35F-4229-B605-CC0F8C16A8FE%7D&1=1&BEMID=97e2c58">here</a>.</p>
					
					<h2 id="invalid">I tried to sign up to become a product tester, but it kept telling me my e-mail address was invalid. What gives?</h2>
					<p>We apologize for the inconvenience. Please send us your contact information in a <a href="<?= SITEURL; ?>/contact">contact form</a> and we'll submit your information manually for you.</p>
					
					<h2 id="next">What do I do after I have been selected?</h2>
					<p>You should receive an e-mail with instructions; please read this carefully. Most importantly, send in your signed and completed affidavit. If you received an e-mail but did not receive an affidavit, please let us know via e-mail or <a href="<?= SITEURL; ?>/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
					
					<h2 id="affidavit">Where do I send in my affidavit?</h2>
					<p>Please consult the original email that you received with the affidavit. If you have questions, you may reply to that email or <a href="<?= SITEURL; ?>/contact">contact us here</a>.</p>
					
					<h2 id="why">Why haven't I been selected?</h2>
					<p>Due to the popularity of our program, it can take a long period of time before you are selected. If selected, we will contact you by e-mail once a product is available for testing. Note that once you submit your information, your will remain on the list. You do not need to resubmit. Because you may be selected any time after you have submitted your information, you may be contacted at a much later date.</p>
					
					<h2 id="howmany">How many products will I receive?</h2>
					<p>We try to give as many people as possible the chance to test products. That said, it's likely you will only receive one product to test.</p>
					
					<h2 id="type">What types of products will I receive?</h2>
					<p>All of the products we test on Recipe4Living are food and cooking-related, whether it be a kitchen utensil, ingredient, or a food to taste. In the past, we have tested products from OXO International, King Arthur Flour, and O Olive Oil.</p>
					
					<h2 id="pick">Can I pick the product I receive?</h2>
					<p>We do not allow testers to pick the products they receive for multiple reasons. We want to allow all products equal opportunity to be tested, as well as prevent any preliminary bias toward products. </p>
					
					<h2 id="guaranteed">Am I guaranteed to receive a product?</h2>
					<p>No one is guaranteed to receive a product. Due to the popularity of this program, we cannot ensure that you will be a product tester. However, we do our best to give as many people as possible the chance!</p>
					
					<h2 id="ensure">What can I do to ensure I am selected?</h2>
					<p>Our testers are often selected at random or based on location for a specific product.</p>
					
					<h2 id="required">If selected, what is required of me as a tester?</h2>
					<p>Each tester is required to fill out the provided survey and write a review about their product. In most cases, you will be required to cook a recipe with your product and tell us about that recipe and your cooking experience in your review. We also encourage each participant to submit a picture with their review.</p>
					
					<h2 id="camera">Your instructions tell me I need to send in a picture, what if I don't have a camera?</h2>
					<p>While we do prefer pictures be sent in with reviews, we understand if circumstances do not allow you to take pictures. We won't count it against you!</p>
					
					<h2 id="submit">How do I submit my review?</h2>
					<p>All reviews and pictures are to be submitted via e-mail. Simply reply back to the e-mail letting you know you have been selected. The survey is separate from the review and should be filled out at the provided link, sent to you via e-mail. Please let us know in the <a href="<?= SITEURL; ?>/contact">contact form</a> if you have been selected but have not yet received your link or instructions.</p>
					
					<h2 id="more">I already tested a product. Will I be sent more?</h2>
					<p>Not necessarily. With all of the people already signed up to become product testers, we try to give as many people as possible the chance to review products.</p>
					
					<h2 id="published">Where can I see my review?</h2>
					<p>Product review articles are published in our Product Review section located under Hints and Tips. Click on the link to find your product and see your review. Please note that all reviews will not be published. If a product has many testers, we pick a handful of reviews to publish. Even if your review is not published on Recipe4Living, it was sent to the company as part of our complete feedback.</p>
